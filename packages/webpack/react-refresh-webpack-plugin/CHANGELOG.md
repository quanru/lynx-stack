# @lynx-js/react-refresh-webpack-plugin

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Add `@lynx-js/react-webpack-plugin` `^0.12.0` to the peer dependency range. ([#3979](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/3979))

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- Allow `@lynx-js/react-webpack-plugin` v0.11 as a peer dependency. ([#3393](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/3393))

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Extend the `@lynx-js/react-webpack-plugin` peer dependency range to allow `^0.10.0`. ([#2826](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2826))

- Fix `isComponent is not a function` crashing the HMR runtime when ReactLynx is consumed as an async external bundle. ([#2928](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2928))

  The refresh helpers were injected via `ProvidePlugin`, whose dependency edge does not participate in async-module handling, so `@lynx-js/react/refresh` resolved to a pending Promise and `isComponent`/`flush` were `undefined`. They now ship as an ESM module (`runtime/refresh.mjs`) injected by the loader as a real import, awaited through the normal async-module machinery.

- Widen the `@lynx-js/react-webpack-plugin` peer range to `^0.10.0` to accept the ([#2584](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2584))
  minor that ships the FetchBundle loader.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE** ([#2803](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2803))

  Drop webpack support — the plugins now target Rspack only. All public types come from `@rspack/core` instead of `webpack` (e.g. `Compiler`, `Compilation`, `LoaderContext`), and the `webpack` dependency is removed.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** ([#2838](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2838))

  Remove `ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin` / `ReactRefreshWebpackPluginOptions`. Use `ReactRefreshRspackPlugin` instead.

## 0.3.6
